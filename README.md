# competitive_programming
Solutions to UVa problems. Also contain few solutions to Spoj problems.
Used this book [Competitive Programming](http://cpbook.net) as guidance.
Some programs(especially DP & greedy part) contain explanations on the correctness proof or recursive formulas used by the algorithm. Some of them are even the only proof in the whole Internet world.
