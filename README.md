# competitive_programming
Solutions to uVA problems. Contains few solutions to Spoj problems.
Used this book [Competitive Programming](http://cpbook.net) as guidance.
Currently switched to [interviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/profile/YangZhao) since problems there are easier. But I'll go back to this after finishing problems on that site.
